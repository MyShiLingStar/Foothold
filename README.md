# Foothold?
Foothold? is a mod for PEAK that visualizes standable ground. This is meant to be used when you're unsure if a part of the wall will work as a foothold or not.

## Usage
Press F to toggle the visualization. It will scan in a 10x10x10 cube and spawn markers for whether ground is standable. A white ball means the ground is standable and a red ball means the ground is not standable. No balls will appear on ground that is less than a 30 degree slope for performance reasons, as it's obvious enough on its own. (And the red ones are more important anyway)

## Configuration
You can configure the activation key in the configuration file at BepInEx/config/Foothold.cfg. It will be autogenerated by BepInEx the first time you run the mod. You can also enable "Fade Away" mode in the config.
