# Foothold?
Foothold? is a mod for PEAK that visualizes standable ground. This is meant to be used when you're unsure if a part of the wall will work as a foothold or not.

## Usage
Press F to toggle the visualization. It will scan in a 10x10x10 cube and spawn markers for whether ground is standable. A white ball means the ground is standable and a red ball means the ground is not standable. No balls will appear on ground that is less than a 30 degree slope for performance reasons, as it's obvious enough on its own. (And the red ones are more important anyway)
